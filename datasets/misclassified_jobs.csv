As a 3D Animator, your main role is to bring virtual worlds to life! Imagine creating everything from fantastic characters to dynamic environments that feel as real as any place you’ve visited. On daily basis, you’ll use specialized computer software to design 3D models of characters and scenes. You’ll also rig characters, which means making them ready to move, and then animate them to walk, talk, or even fly!

Your job doesn’t stop there; you’ll work with textures and lighting to make scenes look believable or fantastical. You must understand how real-world physics works to make animations look logical and appealing. Sometimes, your creations will be used in augmented reality - which mixes real-world views with computer-generated scenes, or holography to create three-dimensional images that float in the air!

You also get to develop the story’s visual flow (storyboarding) and manage your workflow to meet project deadlines. Occasionally, you'll need to ensure that all the audio and visuals you use have the right permissions for use. Creative thinking and drawing are part of your everyday tools to make your animated stories come alive.

Are you someone who loves animals and is great at organizing details?

As a Zoo Registrar, you'll have an important job ensuring that all the animals in the zoo are taken care of and meet all legal requirements. You’ll manage records about each animal—like where they came from, their health, and any special needs they have. This involves a lot of paperwork and using computer systems to keep track of information accurately.

You'll also make sure that whenever animals need to be transported, everything goes smoothly. This means working out the details of how and when animals are moved, keeping costs efficient, and making sure all the rules for animal transport are followed. You'll work with many different people, from those inside the zoo to external transportation companies, so being good at talking in various languages and through different tools (like emails, phone calls, or face-to-face) will help a lot.

Every day, you’ll be solving problems, updating data, and ensuring that all the information you handle is accurate and up to date. It's a job that keeps you on your toes and makes a big difference in how well the zoo operates and how happy and healthy the animals are.","9","10","10","2","2","4","4","22","Agriculture and Animal Husbandry"
